//Title: Clock In/Clock Out Express
//Date: 2/29/2016
//Purpose: This application lets a user enter the time clocked in, time clocked out, and hourly pay rate.
//The program calculates the total time the user worked and how much money the user made for the work day.
//Note:  For the time in hours from 1 am to 12 pm, use numbers 1 through 12.  
//For hours from 1 pm to 12 am, use numbers 13 through 24.  Enter any number from 0 to 59 for the time in minutes.
